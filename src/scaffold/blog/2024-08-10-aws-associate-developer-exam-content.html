                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>
                        I have decided to study and take the AWS associate developer exam (<a href="2024-07-10-aws-certification.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>) so I should start by looking at the content of the exam. <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-dev-associate/AWS-Certified-Developer-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">This PDF</a> (also linked <a href="img/2024-08-10-aws-associate-developer-exam-content/AWS-Certified-Developer-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for reference in case the original link changes) summarises the content of the exam.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Domains</h3>

                    <p>
                        The exam is divided into the following four domains and each domain has a different weighting in the exam (as shown by the percentage in the brackets):
                        <ol>
                            <li>Development with AWS Services (32%)</li>
                            <li>Security (26%)</li>
                            <li>Deployment (24%)</li>
                            <li>Troubleshooting and Optimization (18%)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Task Statements</h3>

                    <p>
                        Each domain is subdivided into a series of task statements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Domain 1 - Development with AWS Services task statements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Develop code for applications hosted on AWS.</li>
                            <li>Develop code for AWS Lambda.</li>
                            <li>Use data stores in application development.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Domain 2 - Security task statements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Implement authentication and/or authorisation for applications and AWS services.</li>
                            <li>Implement encryption by using AWS services.</li>
                            <li>Manage sensitive data in application code.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Domain 3 - Deployment task statements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Prepare application artifacts to be deployed to AWS.</li>
                            <li>Test applications in development environments.</li>
                            <li>Automated deployment testing.</li>
                            <li>Deploy code by using AWS CI/CD services.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Domain 4 - Troubleshooting and Optimisation task statements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Assist in a root cause analysis.</li>
                            <li>Instrument code for observability.</li>
                            <li>Opimise applications by using AWS services and features.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Knowledge and Skills</h3>

                    <p>
                        Each task statement is further broken down into a set of knowledge points and skills. I won't list this them all in this page. But one of the things I like to do when studying for something is to a have checklist of the subjects that I can mark myself against so I know which areas I need to focus on the most. So I've created <a href="img/2024-08-10-aws-associate-developer-exam-content/AWS Developer Associate Exam Checklist.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> checklist based on the domains, task statements, knowledge and skills.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>AWS Services</h3>

                    <p>
                        The appendix of the exam content from AWS also lists all the in and out of scope AWS services the exam can cover. Both these list are (quote) non-exhaustive and subject to change. Which isn't very helpful. I'm taking it as all services are fair game and could be mentioned/referenced on the exam. So it's probably a good idea to at least have an idea of what each service is used for/it's purpose even if I don't learn specifically about it during study.
                    </p>
